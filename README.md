In this work we propose an original "Reverse Method" to assign galaxy stellar masses to a dark matter catalogue from galaxy
size. We use the linear relation between the galaxy effective radius and halo virial radius R 1/2 =AkR halo to assign galaxy size.
We vary the A k normalisation and Ïƒ k scatter until we match the mock data size function to the SDSS data size function. Stellar
Mass is assigned from the observed mass-size distributions of SDSS. The original mapping of halo mass to stellar mass through
galaxy size is compared to the traditional Abundance Matching. We find that to match the size function the applied scatter should
be higher for the low stellar mass galaxies at 0.22 dex and should reduce to 0.14 dex for Ultra Massive Galaxies (UMG). This
suggests that for UMGs the scatter in size can be explained by physical mechanisms in the SMHM relation, whereas for low mass
galaxies the scatter is from unknown physical mechanisms. The Reverse Method is successful in reproducing the size function,
the stellar mass function (SMF) and the two point projected correlation except for the high mass end (>11 [log10(M )]). The
failure of the clustering in the high mass end is explained by the large scatter applied to match the size function of SDSS. In
comparison to this, Abundance Matching is able to reproduce the SMF and clustering for all masses. The ability of Abundance
Matching to reproduce more of the observed data compared to the Reverse Method suggest that the Stellar Mass -Halo Mass
relation is more fundamental than Galaxy Size-Halo size relation when it comes correlating haloes and galaxies.
